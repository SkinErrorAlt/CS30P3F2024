I was once a (small kid) in a world of the unknown. I was once told I was never seen with a smile or a frown.
Even when the world started to lose color I was always normal.

There was a day (the one day that I feel down) I was left puzzled. I actually felt emotion again. I didn't know the feel of it.
After years of not knowing. I knew how it felt to feel again.

That is the day I realized I was being left behind in a world of color.
